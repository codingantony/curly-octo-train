# Candyman
<p>Let me tell you a story, about a candy man</p>
<p>Legend says, if you tell his name in mirror 5 times, you can bring him back to life</p>
<p>Candaman had a hook for his hand and was giving out chocolates to kids</p>
<p>once a girl found razor in her candy and called the cops</p>
<p>cops immediately found the man and killed him on the spot</p>
<p>do you know what they fond afterwards, more razors</p>
<p>candyman was inocent all along, but thier narrow mind didn't allowed to see the picture</p>
<p>once there was a boy who played in the backyard</p>
<p>white girl accused him of stealing something</p>
<p>which boy didn't commit, hence he was send to jail just beacause of that</p>
<p>he was sent to chair to die</p>
<p>but he really didn't die, did he</p>
<p>he came back with the hook for revenge</p>
